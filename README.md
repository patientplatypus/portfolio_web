# Python Picture Swapper

## Motivation

This is the first portfolio that I made. It has a few warts, but I'm very proud of it. It does some pretty cool things too!

## What It Is

A simple portfolio demonstrating some of my programming skills. It features a splash header for my photo and name, a skills sections where I can demonstrate some things that I can do, a portfolio section that features some projects, and an email section where people could message me.

## Technologies Used

I used jQuery for the site including the velocity.js animation package. Formatting was done in bootstrap and the email form was through formspree.io.

## How to run

1. Clone databases

2. python -m SimpleHTTPServer

3. Navigate to localhost and given port
